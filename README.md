# Discrete Fourier Transform Calculator
**University task, Digital Signal Processing**  

The `C++` application simply takes the **N-point** sampling rate from the user alongside the actual **x vector** and prints the following:

	- Wn (Omega n) Matrix Values
	- X[N] vector
	- Magnitude of each vector elemnt
	- Phase of each vector elemnt
 - If you're going to download/clone the repo, you are interested in the following files ONLY:
	 - `run.bat` Simple batch file to compile and run main.cpp
	 - `Complex.h` Header file for the custom Complex Numbers code
	 - `main.cpp`	Main code file, contains functions and Complex.h utilization
	 - `main.out` Output of G++ compiler to be used to run the program
 - Run the app from `run.bat` file (support infinite looping to try multiple problems without having to restart the bash)

*The `.cpp` file has comments implemented to try to explain the code as easy as possible, although, the header file `.h` don't yet have comments, but I think it is pretty much straight forward there.*
